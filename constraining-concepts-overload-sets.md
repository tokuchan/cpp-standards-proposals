Abstract
--------

The central purpose of Concepts is to simplify generic programming such that it is approachable to the
non-expert developer.  In general it makes great strides towards this end particularly in the capacity
of invoking a generic function; however, the Concepts design does not deliver on this promise in the
implementation of a generic function.  This is because the feature does not constrain the overload set
of a template-concept function itself.  This is contrary to the expectations of non-experts, because
to them Concepts should strongly resemble the callable properties of an interface.  This mental model
drives their expectations to believe that Concepts offer a mechanism to limit the set of operations
which would be visible from within their constrained function to those which are specified by concept
used by the constrained function.

The fact that this is not the case in constrained functions can lead to surprising violations of
the author's expectations thereof.  Unfortunately, this oversight cannot be corrected later.  To correct
this later would entail silent behavioral changes to existing code after the release of Concepts in a
standard.  In other words, this is our only chance to get this right.


Simple Motivating Example
-------------------------

```
// Assume a concept, `IntegerSerializer` which requires a member function called `serialize` which
// takes an `int` and returns a `std::string` with the representation of that integer, in the format
// appropriate to the implementation.

class SimpleSerializer {
    std::string serialize( int value );
};

struct PrecisionSerializer {
    std::string serialize( double preciseValue );
};

struct LoanInterestSerializer {
    std::string serialize( int interestBasisPoints );
    std::string serialize( double interestRate );
};

std::string formatLogarithmicValue( IntegerSerializer &serializer, int integerValue ) {
    return serializer.serialize( std::log( integerValue ) );
}
```

The issue is in what kind of object we pass to `formatLogarithmicValue`.  If we pass an `SimpleSerializer`,
then no surprises happen -- the `double` is implicitly converted to `int`.  If we pass `PrecisionSerializer`,
then the definition of the concept will pass and an implicit conversion to `int` will happen, which is
potentially surprising; however, many programmers are reasonably comfortable with the idea of fundamental
type conversions.  The most surprising case is that of `LoanInterestSerializer`.  `LoanInterestSerializer`
provides a `double` and an `int` overload.  Although the concept requested function with a signature that
accepts an `int`, the overload which accepts `double` in its signature will be called.

From the perspective of the compiler, the way it will actually compile the function `formatLogarithmicValue`
is as if it were written:

```
template< typename IntegerSerializer >
std::string
formatLogarithmicValue( IntegerSerializer &serializer, int integerValue ) {
    return serializer.serialize( std::log( integerValue ) );
}
```

At this point, the invocation of `IntegerSerializer::serializer` will be whatever best matches
`decltype( std::log( integerValue ) )`, which is the overload with `double` as its parameter.
This is likely surprising behavior to the author of `formatLogarithmicValue`, as well as the caller
of `formatLogarithmicValue`.  Both of these authors would expect that the constraints described by
the concept would be obeyed, yet paradoxically the overload which was not the best match for the
constraint was actually the overload that was actually invoked in the body of the "constrained"
function!

The only way for an author of such a constrained function to avoid this, at present, is to rewrite
`formatLogarithmicValue` in such a way as to prevent the incorrect lookup.  Unfortunately, this requires
a level of C++  expertise regarding name lookup and overload resolution which is at odds with the level
of expertise expected of the audience of Concepts, viz. the non-expert programmer.  Such a rewrite
might appear thus:

```
std::string
formatLogarithmicValue( IntegerSerializer &serializer, int integerValue ) {
    return std::as_const( serializer ).serialize( static_cast< int >(
            std::log( std::as_const( integerValue ) ) ) );
}
```

This does not appear to be code that would be expected of the audience targetted by Concepts.  Additionally,
although one of the authors of this paper is author of `std::as_const`, this is not the purpose nor audience
he had in mind when he proposed it.

An Example at Scale
-------------------

```
namespace ConceptLibrary {
    // Assume a concept, `Stringable` which requires a member function called `toString` which
    // when called returns a string representation of the object.
}

namespace PayrollLibrary {
	class Employee {
		private:
			std::string name;

		public:
			Employee( std::string initialName );

            // This satisfies the Stringable concept, and the author of this type knows that.
			std::string toString() const;

			bool operator == ( const Employee &rhs ) const;

            // The following functions are friend, to indicate that ADL is intended.

            // Terminate the specified employee's employment
            friend void fire( const Employee &emp );

            // Initiate the specified employee's employment
            friend void hire( Employee emp );

            // Returns true if the specified employee is employed and false otherwise.
            friend bool worksHere( const Employee &emp );
	};
}

namespace AlgorithmLibrary {
	// This "fires" off a stringable object to be processed.
	void fire( const ConceptLibrary::Stringable &s ) {
        std::cout << "I am interested in " << s.toString() << std::endl;
    }

	void
	printAll( const std::vector< ConceptLibrary::Stringable > &v ) {
		for( auto &&s: v ) fire( s );
	}
}

namespace UserProgram {
	void code() {
        std::vector< PayrollLibrary::Employee > team;
		team.emplace_back( "John Doe" );
		AlgorithmLibrary::printAll( team );
	}
}
```

In this example the intent of the three separate authors is apparent.  The author of the `PayrollLibrary`
simply wished to afford his users the ability to represent employees at a company.  The author of the
`AlgorithmLibrary` wished to afford his users the ability to print printable things and needed to write
an internal helper method to better organize his code.  The author of `UserProgram` naievely wished
to combine these reusable components for a simple task.  However, a subtle behavior of name lookup
in function templates resulted in the termination of employees, rather than the intended call to an
implementation detail.  This happened because the name of the implementation detail happened to collide
with the name of some irrelevant API in the `Employee` object being processed.  Recall that the author of
`AlgorithmLibrary` is likely unaware of the fact that types may exist which are `Stringable` and yet
interfere with the name he chose for his internal implementation detail.

The authors of this paper recognize the importance of respecting the original intent of the programmers
of these components without burying them in the details of defensive template writing.  These kinds of
examples will come up frequently and perniciously in codebases which import third party libraries and
work in multiple groups each with different naming conventions.  Even without variance in naming conventions,
names that have multiple meanings to multiple people are likely to be used across disparate parts of
a codebase, and thus they are more likely to exhibit this pathological behavior.


Why it is Important to Address this Now
---------------------------------------

Should the terse syntax be accepted into the current standard, without addressing this issue, then
future attempts to repair this oversight in the language specification, leave us with one of two
incredibly unpallateable alternatives and one unsatisfying one:

 1. Make constraint violations an error, thus requiring extreme verbosity.
 2. Silently change the meaning of existing code, with ODR implications, because these constrained functions
    are templates.
 3. Introduce a new syntax for indicating that a function definition should be processed in a manner which
    is more consistent with average programmer expectations; 

In the first case, vast amounts of code will fail to compile in noisy ways.  After that point, the user code
would need to be rewritten, in a manner similar to the necessary rewrites as described above. 

In the second case, massive fallout from ODR, silent subtle semantic changes, and other unforseen dangers
lie in wait.

In the third case, the benefits of the "natural" syntax are lost, as the best syntax for beginners is no
longer the natural syntax!  This obviously defeats the intended purpose of Concepts with a natural syntax.

Some Design Philosophy
----------------------

There are other cases where current Concepts can cause incorrect lookup.  This fails to deliver upon a big
part of the expected benefits of this language feature.  The comparison has been drawn between C++ Virtual
Functions and Concepts.  As Concepts are being presented to bring generic programming to the masses,
it is vital that 3 core safety requirements be considered.  These requirements are similar to aspects
of Object Oriented Programming.

1. An object passed to a function must meet the qualifications that a concept describes.  This is
   analagous to how a function taking a pointer or reference to a class has the parameter checked for
   substitutiablility.  The current Concepts proposal provides this extremely well.

2. An object written to be used as a model of a concept should have its definition checked for completeness
   by the compiler.  This is analagous to how a class is checked for abstractness vs concreteness.  The
   current Concepts proposal lacks this; however, this is approximated very well, by the concept checking
   machinery.  This guarantees that every class which is matched to concept provides a definition for every
   required operation under that concept, thus satisfying the requirements of the concept.

3. A constrained function is only capable of calling the functions on its parameters that are described by
   its constraining Concepts.  This is analagous to how a function taking a pointer to base is only allowed
   to call members of the base -- new APIs added in any derived class are not considered to be better
   matches, ever.  The current Concepts proposal lacks anything resembling this, and this oversight has yet
   to be addressed.  It is this deficiency which our paper seeks to remedy.

We propose that the Concepts feature is incomplete without constrained overload set for usage, thus satisfying
the third requirement of any interface-like abstraction.  It is vital that we explore this issue.

We recognize that some complexity in the space of constrained generics will always be present, but we feel
that it is best to offload this complexity to the author of a concept rather than to the implementor of a
constrained function.  This is because we believe that fewer concept authors will exist than concept "users".
Additionally, the level of expertise of a concept author is inherently higher than the intended audience
of constrained functions.  In the worst case scenario, a naive definition of a concept will merely result
in a few missed opportunities for more suitable overloads to handle move semantics, avoid conversions,
and other shenanigans

What This Paper is  _<b><u>NOT</b></u>_  Proposing
--------------------------------------------------

 1. Full Static Definition Checking
 2. C++0x Concept Checking
 3. C++0x Concept Maps
 4. The generation of "invisible" proxy types
 5. The generation of "invisible" inline proxy functions
 6. Dynamic dispatch
 7. Function call tables
 8. Implicit generation of adaptors 
 9. Any form of extra code generation
10. Any form of extra type generation
11. Relying upon the optimizer to make any aspect of the code generated by this solution more efficient


Our Proposed Solution
---------------------

We propose a moderate alteration of the overload resolution rules and name lookup rules that
statically filters out some overloads based upon whether those functions are used to satisfy the
concept's requirements.  This constrained overload set hides some functions from visibility in
the definition of constrained functions.  No change should be necessary to the rules of name
lookup itself; however, our new overload resolution rules will affect the results of names
found by unqualified name lookup in constrained functions-- this is by design.


Specifically, our design is to change overload resolution to be the following (taken from cppreference.com's
description of the overload resolution rules):

<table border=10>
<tr>
<td>
##Current overload resolution
<td>
##Desired overload resolution
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<p>
Given the set of candidate functions, constructed as described above, the next step of overload
resolution is examining arguments and parameters to reduce the set to the set of viable functions
<p>
To be included in the set of viable functions, the candidate function must satisfy the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li> If there are M arguments, the candidate function that has exactly M parameters is viable
<li> If the candidate function has less than M parameters, but has an ellipsis parameter, it is viable.
<li> If the candidate function has more than M parameters and the M+1'st parameter and all parameters
that follow must have default arguments, it is viable. For the rest of overload resolution, the
parameter list is truncated at M.

<li> If the function has an associated constraint, it must be satisfied
	(since C++20)

<li> For every argument there must be at least one implicit conversion sequence that converts it to the
corresponding parameter.
<li> If any parameter has reference type, reference binding is accounted for at this step: if an rvalue
argument corresponds to non-const lvalue reference parameter or an lvalue argument corresponds to rvalue
reference parameter, the function is not viable.

Objections, Questions, and Concerns
-----------------------------------

Q: Isn't this just C++0x Concepts with definition checking all over again?
A: No.  C++0x Concepts used mechanisms and techniques which are drastically different to the solution
   we have proposed.  We require no generation of any adaptors, maps, or proxies.  We propose altering
   and refining the lookup rules to further obey the restrictions imposed by Concepts, in a manner similar
   to what is already in the existing design.  We feel that this is appropriate, because Concepts already
   requires some alteration to the lookup rules, and our design appears to be consistent with the general
   lookup rule restrictions thereby imposed.  Concept restrictions are enforced in C++ through lookup rules,
   not through any other mechanism.

Q: Will I be able to call internal helper functions to my constrained function using an unqualified name?
A: Yes.  We place no restrictions on the calling of functions in namespaces that are unrelated to the
   concept used in a constraint.  The namespaces associated with the types that are constrained are also
   still searched, but only the names which are necessary (in some fashion) to meet the requirements of the
   concept are considered to be viable.  In some sense this is the existing Concepts restriction on calling
   a constrained function applied in reverse -- constraints restrict which functions are called based upon
   their arguments.  The current restriction prevents calling a function which is not prepared to accept
   a type.  Our refinement prevents calling a function which is not presented as part of the requirements
   on a type.

Q: Isn't your real problem with {ADL, const vs. non-const overloads, overload resolution, dependent lookup,
   etc.} and not with the lookup rules of Concepts today?
A: Absolutely not.  We have examples of unexpected lookup for each and every one of these cases.  We are
   not convinced that our problem is with every single one of the above aspects of the language.  There
   are some cases which will be redundantly resolved by improving those aspects of the language; however,
   many problem cases within each of these domains still remains.  This is especially true of ADL functions.
   ADL functions are intended to be part of the interface of a class; however, a constrained value is also
   a constrained interface.

Q: How do I actually invoke ADL functions that I want invoked in my constrained functions?

Q: What about calling efficient `swap` on an `Assignable`?


Design Considerations
---------------------

- Where these rules might apply:
  - Explicit templates
  - Any terse syntax templates
  - Any constrained templates

There are a few different  in which

Any design that proposes to change lookup rules should not invalidate any code written under those
rules today.  Because of this, we do not propose that the lookup rules should be changed when
evaluating names within a "classical" template context.  However, we see a number of opportunities
to apply our modified lookup scheme:

### Terse syntax constrained functions

The terse syntax intends to open generic programming to a wider audience, as discussed earlier.
We feel that it is obvious that such terse syntax functions be subject to rules which provide a more
intuitive result.  Therefore we suggest that any terse syntax considered by the committe must have
the intuitive semantics provided by our proposal.

### Template syntax constrained function

####  All constrained function templates

Any expansion of a terse syntax from the terse form into a "canonical" production of a constrained
template function declaration could automatically have these rules applied.  This seems fairly obvious
in many respects, because the purpose of Concepts are to afford better selection of applicable functions
in name lookup and overload resolution.  When a user writes a constrained function, even using template
syntax, he or she is explicitly choosing to have the semantics of Concepts applied to their function.
Therefore, it seems like a reasonable choice to make every constrained function obey these lookup rules.


#### Opt-in for these rules as part of the definition of a constrained function template

We acknowledge that the application of these constrained lookup rules in the definition of a function A
user acting in good faith, trying to modernize a code base, from unconstrained templates to constrained
templates, who does not use the terse syntax, may wind up causing subtle changes in the semantics and or
ODR violations.  Additionally, the template expert is already intimately familiar with the consequences of
C++'s uninituitive lookup rules in templates and may wish to leverage the semantics afforded by these rules
in the implementation of his template function -- he only wishes to constrain the callers, but not himself.

Therefore it may be necessary to control the application of this modified rule through the use of
a signifying keyword.  We propose `explicit template< ... >`, as this syntax, as it reads reasonably
well and clearly indicates intent.  Although this proposed syntax uses the `template` keyword, which is
already indicitive of potential lookup dangers, it eschews the pitfalls for the `template< ... >` case.

Whichever of the choices for the application of modified lookup rules to constrained function templates,
the language loses no expressivity as choice is possible under each alternative.


### Behavior of These Rules Under Short Circuit of Disjunction

- Does short-circuit behavior of concept satisfaction make certain overloads invisible, or should
  both sides of a disjunction be followed for the purposes of "constrained name lookup".

We preserve the viability of overloads which are found on either branch of a disjunction, because
a user would reasonably expect these overloads to be available if those constraints are satisfied.
For branches of a disjunction which are not satisfied, those overloads will be unavailable, as 
the constraint wasn't satisfied.  This seems to result in a viable overload set which most closely
conforms to user expectations.

######## Notes




- Calls dependent upon a constrained parameter are the only calls whose name lookup we propose to modify.
  (Sort of answered all over.)

- Clarify the helpers problem.  (We believe that our solution does handle this.) (Answered in Q&A)
