Introduction
------------

The C++ Library Fundamentals TS, N4023 specifies a set of functions `htonl` and
friends, which perform in a similar manner to the ubiquitous `htonl` and friends
of the Berkeley Sockets API.  The problem is that many existing deployments of
this API specify `htonl` as a macro, on some or all compilation modes.  The
basic definitions are found in section 10.1 of the paper, titled
`[header.net.synop]`.


The Issue
---------

The following code examples illustrate the problems which may occur, in
production, due to the proposed 'htonl' and friends named functions.

    --- System Header, such as `sys/network.h` ---
    // ...
    #define htonl( x ) /* Implementation specific way to convert ... */
    // ...

    --- End of System Header, such as `network.h` ---

    --- Example impl for `experimental/net` ---
    // ...

    namespace std {
    namespace experimental {
    inline namespace fundamentals_v1 {
    namespace net {
        // ...
        constexpr uint32_t htonl(uint32_t host) noexcept;
        // ...
    } // net
    } // fundamentals_v1
    } // experimental
    } // std
    --- End of TS impl for `experimental/net` ---


    --- My program `main.cpp` ---
    #include <sys/network.h>
    #include <experimental/net>   // XXX: Parse error may occur in here

    //...
    --- End of My program `main.cpp` ---


    --- My other program `main2.cpp` ---
    #include <experimental/net>
    #include <sys/network.h>

    int
    main()
    {
        namespace TS= std::experimental;
        TS::net::htonl(42); // XXX: Syntax error if `htonl` is a macro.
        using TS::net::htonl; // XXX: Syntax error if `htonl` is a macro.
        using namespace std::experimental::net; // Okay.

        // XXX: This line will fail to compile if `htonl` is a function -- it's
        // an ambiguous overload.  This line will succeed if `htonl` is a macro,
        // but invoke the macro, not the C++-TS implementation.
        htonl( 42 );
    }
    --- End of My other program `main2.cpp` ---

This then would give rise to a mandate that `<experimental/net>` be included
_before_ all inclusions of `sys/network.h`, or some similar rule, but usage of
`std::experimental::net::htonl` would cause a syntax error, upon macro expansion
of the token `htonl`.


Analysis
--------


The conflict with existing Berkeley Sockets API implementations is significantly
compounded by the hazards of transitive include in large bodies of existing
code.  Note that the Berkeley Sockets API is the de facto networking standard
for all C-based languages.  At best, the `<experimental/net>` implementations of
`htonl` and friends become unusable... at worst, there are myriad, subtle parse
and syntax errors which will arise under different inclusion order (sometimes
sparked by changes to headers outside of the author's control.)

This TS places a severe burden upon OS vendors (and authors) to change their
existing practices (often mostly written in C), to accommodate this new C++
`feature`.  Such changes may be impossible, or unduly hard in exchange for what
these vendors and authors might consider a questionable benefit to the users of
their systems.  This TS introduces further incompatibilities between C and C++
-- a situation which we should strive to avoid, if we can.

In the C language, many functions are permitted to be defined as macros, at an
implementation's discretion.  POSIX itself permits an implementation to define
`htonl` and friends as macros.  The Linux kernel, the FreeBSD system, and
several others all conditionally define `htonl` as a macro, depending upon
availability of compiler primitives, and system target.  We feel that a mandate
to forbid `htonl` from being a macro would be unnecessarily difficult to effect,
and would be an inappropriate suggestion from the C++ committee at this time.

We feel that it is a mistake to define names in the standard library that might
conflict with existing popular implementations which define the same names as
macros.  Doing so will cause otherwise avoidable headache for numerous POSIX
oriented systems.


Scope of the Problem
--------------------

There are numerous open source projects, implemented wholly, or partially in
C++, which are mission-critical for numerous organizations, businesses,
projects, and people.  Examples include Clang, GCC (>=4.8), Firefox, Chromium,
KDE, QT, JVM, Audacity, DOSBox, and VLC.  As many (or most) of these have some
form of networking support, a C++ standard (or soon-to-be-standard) header which
defines these names could potentially jeopardize the future compilation of these
projects out-of-the-box on many open source operating systems.

The situation is compounded by the existence of numerous libraries in C and C++,
open source or otherwise which either declare their own or transitively include
implementations of `htonl` and friends.  Therefore, mandating that
`<experimental/net>` be included either before or after would not be a workable
solution.


Proposed Solution
-----------------

We strongly encourage the Committee to strike the `htonl`, `ntohl`, `htons`, and
`ntohs` functions in the `std::experimental::network` namespace, in the Library
Fundamentals TS (N4023).
